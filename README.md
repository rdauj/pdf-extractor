pdf-extractor
=============

Extracts text from pdf files using pdf_reader gem, then separately finds sentences with specified keywords inside.

Written to help archive the backlog of old pdf research files stored at a hospital. Goal of this project is a program
that can automatically detect keywords in pdf files and sort them accordingly, such that it's easier for users to find 
relevant material.

I'll be updating this over some time as I figure out the best way to do this. 
I'm a ruby nuby so any critique or pointers are highly appreciated!
